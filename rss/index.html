It still gives the player multitude of playstyles, is still APM heavy, still requires tons of enemy-pattern recognition and foremost still traps the player in a never-ending cycle of wanting more. The catch is: it can be played simultaneously up to 3 players. That and its transition to a beautifully rendered 3D top-down setting. Those changes are far from anecdotal and required by themselves a ton of experimentation. </p>

<p>I was hired as a full-time freelance game dev for more than 2 years. At the time they already went through a lot but the pre-prod phase was still going strong and many questions still needed answers. I mainly helped on designing and prototyping trinkets, team-moves (&quot;fishes&quot;) but also weapons and enemies. The team heavily relies on iterating ideas and testing them internally and the nature of tasks given to team members were rotating quite frequently as well. I therefore had the pleasure to work with almost everyone on the team and not just on core-gameplay features but also VFX, UX, AI and UI.</p><p>I&apos;m really thankful for having been by their side during this time - especially to Thomas Vasseur, S&#xE9;bastien Violier and Yannick Berthier which gave me a huge xp boost that will carry me for years to come &lt;3. The game&apos;s early-access is expected very soon and I&apos;m looking forward to see players streams and (hopefully not) hear the team complain about their player base &#x1F61B;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My ordinary life (gamejam)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/49/my-ordinary-life?ref=localhost">My ordinary life</a> is our entry for the ludum dare #49.

The already established competitive player-base we had rekindled since the remaster was giving us major clues on how to approach new mechanics. We felt that playstyle displayed by the WJ2 community at a higher level of play were rather defensive and that it was lacking a variety of playstyle that can be found on fighting games. Along with Jordi Asensio I designed and programmed the jump, slapshop, dropshot and X-moves mechanics as well as the AI, game-design tools and fmod implementations. </p>

<p>Being somewhat a competitive player myself I loved the back and forth tuning we had in balancing moves and introducing mechanics, the dialog we had with the windjammers community and the passion involved. It&apos;s hard to keep a good balance when some players are rather conservative and others thriving for new stuff but we know we made good calls when they share warm emotions after a close game!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Homecooked (gamejam)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/homecooked?ref=localhost">Homecooked</a> is a game about taking care of a depressed friend, talking and cooking for them.

Also the sun is running away for some reason so you&apos;ll need to catch up with him or else you will die. That&apos;s the whole plot of Seeking Light, a game made by @frosk404 (ld) @snowpriestess (art) and myself (prog) for the ludum dare #39 &quot;Running out of Power&quot; in 3days. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.fabykun.st/content/images/2021/09/seekinglight.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Seeking Light (gamejam)" loading="lazy" width="320" height="256"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Gameplay gif</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most of my work was related to the plant-physics. I heavily used HingeJoints and the rest was editor scripting and planty (did you get it?) of iterations. Nothing too complicated to really talk about and the code must be dirty, it&#x2019;s a gamejam after all !
